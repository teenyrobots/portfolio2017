			<p><em>Futurism! The card game</em> is a prototype game for 4+ players about art history. My goal was to create a game that gave players a sense of the chaos of the 1920's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism" target="_blank">Futurist art movement</a>. The Futurists glorified speed, youth, technology, and violence, and generally wanted to raze the world of art and culture and remake it. While the leaders of the movement were a crew of misogynistic book burners (which is pretty terminally uncool), the sentiment of embracing new tech, running wild, and setting fire to the past serves as a resonant response to contempoary think pieces about millenials.</p>

			<p>Players are dealt a hand of cards with lines of poetry representing courage, audacity, and revolt, as well as modifier cards. A "danger condition" is laid out on the table, and the goal for each player is to create a poem from their hand that matches the condition as closely as possible without being the last to lay down a poem. Technology cards modify player poems, and BURN IT ALL DOWN cards allow the player to sweep all the cards currently on the table onto the floor (use wisely--those cards won't be reshuffled into the poetry deck). The first player to win ten rounds takes the game.</p>
