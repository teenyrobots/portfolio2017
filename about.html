				<h3>More about me</h3>

				<img src="images/joycer.jpg" id="bioPic">

				<p>I'm an designer, illustrator, and all-around digital media witch. <strong>I design websites, digital products, and infographics to help folks tell better stories</strong>.</p>

				<p>In 2012 I cofounded Symbolia, an interactive digital magazine that published long-form journalism told through comics until 2015. From 2015-2016, I was a fellow with the JoLT (Journalism Leadership Transformation) initiative at American University studying the intersection of game design and news media. I teach Digital Comics in the Comics MFA program at California College of the Arts. I've worked with clients like Vox Media, the Online News Association, Bed Bath Beyond, and more. For a full list, <a href="cv.html">have a look at my CV here</a>.</p>

				<p>My work has appeared in Columbia Journalism Review, has been written about in FastCo., Poynter, and other outlets, and I have spoken about telling better stories at SXSW, Game Developer's Conference, on The Verge's Top Shelf, and others. I love conversations about design, collaboration, and playspaces, and I'm super interested in what different kinds of digital or social interactivity could do to make these things more exciting for our audiences.</p>

				<p>I have a BFA in Illustration, an MA in Game Design, and excellent proficiency in Adobe CC, Sketch, HTML, CSS, and Unity.</p>

				<p>I <a href="http://blog.teenyrobots.net" target="_blank">draw</a>, <a href="http://tourace.tumblr.com" target="_blank">ride bikes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/teenyrobots" target="_blank">code</a>, and sleep in Chicago (mostly).</p>

				<p>If you're interested in working together, send me an email at joycer at teenyrobots dot net telling me more about your project!<p/>
